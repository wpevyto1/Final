      <p>
        In December of 2020 my son Mason turned six months old. With the COVID pandemic spiking, I was cooped up in the
        house
        and I figured it was a perfect opportunity GO ALL OUT and celebrate his half birthday! I mean my husband and I
        survived
        6 months of being brand new parents.. during a pandemic, if that’s not worth celebrating, I don't know what is!
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway I went ALL OUT! I made a birthday banner, a crown, paper fan decorations, balloon bundles, a "half"
        birthday
        cake, cake pops and crocheted him a baby Sloth. All for my husband and I to enjoy together... just us.. and the
        baby... and the dog.
      </p>

      <p>
        Did I stay up WAY too late (the night before) making all of these things? Absolutely. Do I regret any of it?
        NO... except
        maybe the cake pops... those are a nightmare to make!
      </p>

      <p>
        So all of this is to say that this is what sparked the actual opening of my business. I posted pictures of my
        creations on social media
        and was flooded with messages asking for me to make them a baby Sloth. I then decided to learn to create other
        animals and see what would happen.
        I once again was messaged by more and more people to create on for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you've made it to the end of this rambling novel... CONGRATS, you win my deepest appreciation!
      </p>

      <p>
        Love Always,
      </p>
