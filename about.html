      <p>
        In December of 2020, my son Mason turned six months old. With the COVID pandemic spiking, I was cooped up in the
        house and I figured it was a perfect opportunity to GO ALL OUT and celebrate his half birthday! I mean my husband and I
        survived 6 months of being brand new parents... during a pandemic. If that’s not worth celebrating, I don't know what is!
      </p>

      <p>
        I went ALL OUT! I made a birthday banner, a crown, paper fan decorations, balloon bundles, a "half"
        birthday cake, cake pops and crocheted him a baby Sloth as a half-birthday present. All for my husband and I to enjoy together... just us... 
        and the baby... and the dog.
      </p>

      <p>
        Did I stay up WAY too late (the night before) making all of these things? Absolutely! Do I regret any of it?
        NO... except maybe the cake pops... those are a nightmare to make!
      </p>

      <p>
        So all of this to say that, this is what sparked the actual opening of my business. I posted pictures of my
        creations on social media and was flooded with messages asking me to make them a special creation for their own kids.
         I then decided to create other animals and see what would happen. I once again was messaged by more and more people to create for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you've made it to the end of this rambling novel... CONGRATS, you win my deepest appreciation!
      </p>

      <p>
        Love Always,
      </p>
